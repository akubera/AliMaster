# AliMaster

AliMaster intends to be a utility for managing files and jobs on CERN's grid through
AliMonitor. It currently uses the commands provided by the AliEn software package. Perhaps
one day there will be python bindings to the services, but until then, AliEn (and AliROOT,
for that matter) should be installed before AliMaster (to do so, follow the guide [here](https://dberzano.github.io/alice/install-aliroot)).
